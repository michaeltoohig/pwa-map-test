# map-test

Primarily a test ground to try some technologies I want to use for an app.

[x] PWA
  [ ] work and load page while offline
  [x] update popup UI
  [x] cache static files such as fonts
  [x] cache map tiles
    [ ] expire map tiles (staleWhileValidate)
    [ ] speed up cache retreival by using indexed key instead of filter
    [ ] handle cache full
[x] WebPush
[x] Map
  [ ] dark theme map design
  [ ] bounded area
  
I want the app to work offline including the map tiles to be cached and preloaded.
I want to be able to support pushing to the end user updates that they request.


## Current task

I now can cache map tiles. I need to be able to expire them and perform a staleWhileRevalidate 
strategy when I pass the expiration date unless we are currently offline then continue using 
the cache. I also need to handle when the cache fills up a clear cache strategy.


## Map Notes

Vector tiles are what we want instead of raster tiles since we live in an area where bandwidth
considerations are paramount. They require more CPU to render though but I'll take that instead 
of consuming bandwidth and phone storage in IndexedDB.

[ ] Leaflet supports vector tiles non-natively - is there a newer alternative for vector tiles?
  Seems leaflet is still good for me and fine, if I'm going to cache tiles then its okay if they 
  are bit larger than vectors since then users with weaker phones will be okay to view the map.
Others:
  - OpenLayers
  - MapBox GL JS


## IndexedDB Notes

Storing blobs is not supported everywhere so need to try and catch apparently.

### Service Worker Notes

Since I want to use WebPush and possibly other sw features I have to use 'InjectManifest' plugin
https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin#which_plugin_to_use

Service workers are not active in development mode. Must build the project then run built files to 
see sw in action.

Globally install `http-server` then run the following `yarn build && cd dist && http-server && cd ..`.
