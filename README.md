# map-test

Primarily a test ground to try some technologies I want to use for an app.

- PWA
- WebPush

I want the app to work offline including the map tiles to be cached and preloaded.
I want to be able to support pushing to the end user updates that they request.

### Service Worker Notes

Since I want to use WebPush and possibly other sw features I have to use 'InjectManifest' plugin

Service workers are not active in development mode. Must build the project then run built files to 
see sw in action.

Globally install `http-server` then run the following `yarn build && cd dist && http-server && cd ..`.
